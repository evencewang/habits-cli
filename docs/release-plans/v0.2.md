# Release Plan v0.2

As we are approaching the end of user testing for the Habits CLI `v0.1.239-alpha`, I'd like to thank everyone who participated in this round of testing and submitted user feedback, either directly or anonymously.

## Bug Fixes

Through testing efforts in the v0.1-alpha release, we identified a few medium- or high-priority bugs as follows:

- The user is unable to enter floating point numbers. For example, with the following command
```bash
habits prop update -p 10.5
```

The program updates user points to `10` instead of `10.5`.

This may also be the case for individual transactions.
