# Habit CLI

## Getting Started

Please refer to the documentation in [the official website](https://habits-cli.jimmy-lan.com)
or [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/lanyanxiang/habits-cli).

## Overview

[View this documentation on a website.](https://habits-cli.jimmy-lan.com)

### Purpose

The habits application seeks to help individuals build up healthy habits.

### Background

Based on existing psychological research, one feels more motivated when the reward of keeping healthy habits and
completing daily tasks is quantified. Further, one's desire to complete a TODO item might become higher when some
randomness of rewards is involved.

### The habits app

The habits application allows individuals to define custom digital properties. Users may use the application to reward
themselves with digital properties whenever they achieve goals, complete tasks, etc. Optionally, the user may also
deduct some digital assets whenever they perform bad habits. The user may define the exchange rate between digital
properties and real-world items.

### The habits CLI

Before I turn this README.md text that you randomly found on GitHub into an academic paper, let's talk about the Habits
command-line interface. (Let me assure you, this is not a school project. As we know, I always like to find some weird
reasons when I want to code some stuff in my leisure time XD)

The Habits CLI allows one to use the Habits app from the command line (isn't this obvious? :D). It is especially useful
for developers or people using their command lines who do not want to switch to a browser or pick up their phone.

Running simple commands such as `habits transaction add` and `habits property update`, individuals can apply rewards to
themselves without leaving their comfortable command line window. The data will be synced across all Habits app
clients (e.g., mobile app and web app).
